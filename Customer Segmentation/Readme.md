## Aim:To segment customers to get a better understanding of them which in turn could be used to increase the revenue of the company.

* Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics.
* Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning in which the algorithm processes our data and divides data into “clusters”. 
* It is a centroid based algorithm in which each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main idea is to reduce the distance between the data points and     their respective cluster centroid.
## Working of K Means Clustering Algorithm
* Specify number of clusters K.(K value can be selected from elbow method)
* Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
* Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isn’t changing.
